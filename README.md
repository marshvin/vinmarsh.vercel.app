<h3 align="center">DESIGN</h3>
The UI UX design was done using *Figma* and my imagination too.<br>
<h3 align="center"> FRONTEND</h3>
I Used HTML, CSS and Javascript for the front-end.
I also used Bootstrap as my CSS framework<br>

So the Backend was only needed for the contact form. 
Here I used PHP and MSQL.<br>
